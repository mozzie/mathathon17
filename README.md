# mathathon17
Base of a code assignment created for Mathathon, a hackathon for math students. Challenge was to computationally reproduce a given image with 30 transparent colored triangles. Scoring is the sum of color differences over all the pixels, with lower score being better. Service receives a JSON of a set of triangles (edge coordinates, RBG values and opacity), constructs the image and then calculates the difference.

## Functionalities

Organizers requested "simple java" to be used in the project. It's a simple base that was distributed to every team with a very simple running solution. Buzzwords: Java, Maven
